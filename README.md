# Hi, I'm Ivan 👋

<strong>I am a Data Engineer and Software Engineer </strong>

Greetings! I'm Ivan, a dedicated Software Engineer with a strong focus on cutting-edge technologies. Over the past five years, I have honed my skills in Python, React, TypeScript, Docker, SQL, and Kubernetes to craft seamless and dynamic user experiences.

My passion for excellence drives me to constantly push the boundaries of innovation. As an inherently ambitious and purposeful individual, I am constantly seeking new challenges to expand my skill set and contribute positively to every project I undertake.

In the realm of mobile development, I'm well-versed in React Native, harnessing its power to create captivating and user-friendly mobile applications.

But my expertise doesn't stop at the front-end. I have ventured into the world of back-end technologies with proficiency in MySQL, MongoDB, .Net, Node.js, Express.js, and Nest.js. This comprehensive knowledge allows me to architect holistic solutions that seamlessly bridge the gap between front-end and back-end.

With a proven track record of delivering exceptional results, I'm ready to embark on new ventures and collaborate on exciting projects. Let's connect and explore how I can contribute to your next innovation-driven endeavor.
